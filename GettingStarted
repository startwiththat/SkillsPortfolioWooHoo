User Interface –
How many pages do we need?

What personal data are we storing? UserName, DisplayName, email, phone, address

Skills – Will these be user defined or hard coded into the software? Do we want users to be able to self-rate on a scale of 1 to 10?

Learning Events – Which skill, mode of learning (for example, class experience, online learning, self-study, project), date, duration (hours?, days? months?), intensity(in-depth, medium, casual)

Links to Projects - web sites you've worked on, other code you've posted on GitHub as examples of your work

For now I think we should not get to crazy about fonts and formatting, but we can look ahead to letting the user have some choice here.

Please comment! Add your ideas, brainstorm away!
